regardless of the year. On the other hand, Electra was expensive in 2018 but their average price was half in 2017! The average Electra bike price varies depending which year you buy your bike. So, make sure to bike your bike right time!

I mostly learned everything about python and SQL from Datacamp webstie. Some of the times, it was hard for me due to the language barriers. My first language is Japnaese. Even considering the disvantage of langauage barriers, I decided to use Datacamp beucase I belive it is one of the greatest places to learn coding. I know I need to learn more and I hope to go to prestigious post-graduate school in the U.S. \n","\n","## Expand a Research and Future Study \n","- I wasn't able to do it but it might be cool to compare electric cars and gas cars. Do electric cars actually help enviroment due to the use of elecrocity? Or are we tricked by the advertisement we see on TV telling us that electric cars such as Tesla are great cars for the earth. If electric cars do help the enviroment, I would like to know the countries that owns the electronic cars the most. the country might be the most eco-frienly country in the world. \n","- I think data is great and fun because it tells the fact subjectively and thanks for reading till the end. I hope we all can be a successful data scientist/ data analyst in the future. Best luck to all of us! :)"]}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
