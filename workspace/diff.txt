Learn Python\" Scholarship on DataCamp and it was open for everyone. \nI decided to join this wonderful event beucase I wanted to know how much I improve my data sicience skills through using Datacamp so far, but also I thought it was great oppotunity for me to start my first programming competion. \n\nSince I graduated from an university with non-techinical degree and wants to purse Data science Masters program in the future, I belive I am eligible to be in this competion. \n\nIn advance, thanks for reading my competion and I hope you can share your thoughts and comment so I can learn and become a better data scientist as well as data analyst. \n\nLet's get started! :)","metadata":{},"id":"a73d44ee-469b-49b3-bd0e-c44310290000","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## 1️⃣ Python 🐍 - CO2 Emissions challenge! \n\n## 📖 Background\nYou volunteer for a public policy advocacy organization in Canada, and your colleague asked you to help her draft recommendations for guidelines on CO2 emissions rules. \n\nAfter researching emissions data for a wide range of Canadian vehicles, she would like you to investigate which vehicles produce lower emissions.","metadata":{},"id":"237b1c84-c993-47dc-ac53-512c903e0c59","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## 💾 The data I\n\n### You have access to seven years of CO2 emissions data for Canadian

model.\n- \"Vehicle Class\" - Vehicle class by utility, capacity, and weight.\n- \"Engine Size(L)\" - The engine's displacement in liters.\n- \"Cylinders\" - The number of cylinders.\n- \"Transmission\" - The transmission type: A = Automatic, AM = Automatic Manual, AS = Automatic with select shift, AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3 - 10 = the number of gears.\n- \"Fuel Type\" - The fuel type: X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol (E85), N = natural gas.\n- \"Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)\" - Combined city/highway (55%/45%) fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).\n- \"CO2 Emissions(g/km)\" - The tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer for combined city and highway driving. \n\nThe data comes from the Government
